julia introduction:
===================
	in 2009 initial version (development started)

	in 2012 completed.

        2012 onwards using developers,computer scientist and mathematicians.
		
	open source and free

	
	developed in MIT in the applied computing group.

	The Julia Programming language was invented by

	1. Jeff Bezanson
	2. stefan karpinski
	3. Viral B. Shah
	4. Alan Edelman
	
	- julia is a high level programming language like python with the  peformance of a fast language like c.
	- julia is a great choice for scientific computing.

	*) Excellent performance
	*) N-dimensinal arrays
	*) parallel and distributed computing
	
	and it is also nice environment for general programming with:

	*) an active ecosystem of packages and good tools for managing 
	
	*) a rich type of system

	*) Iterators, asynchronous tasks and coroutines.

	*) popularity is incrasing in Technical, data science and high performance computing data.
	*) high level flexible programming language.
	*) easy to learn and fast to execute.
	*) Faster than current programming language.(R,python,matlab 
	*) julia joining or concatenation operator : *
	*) julia is open source free.

environment setup:

	don't forget tick to add path.

julia has two modes :
====================

	1) interactive mode (REPL)
		R- read
		E - evalute
		p - print
		L - loop
		single line command		
	2) non- interactive mode
		- script file mode
		meaning(multiple line codes)
		.jl extension
		
		vs code or atom or sublime text
